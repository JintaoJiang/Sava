File explanation: 
GraphProcessor.java is the Sava program. Both worker and master implementations are inside that file.
Server.java is the client machine waiting for user's inputs.
MembershipManager.java is used for sending heartbeat and detect machine failure. 
FileManager.java and Run.java is used for file transfer in SDFS.
Vertex.java is abstract class, a superclass for ShortestPathVertex.java and PageRankVertex.java. Those two class should be submitted by users. 
Graph.txt is the data for testing. Should unzip it first. 

Compile: 
Type "sh run.sh" for all VMs.

Run: 
Start the introducer first and specify vertex type and iterations there. See server.java for command.
